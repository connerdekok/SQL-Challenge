# SQL-Challenge

Title- Homework Module 9 SQL Challenge- Conner Dekok

In this assignment we used PgAdmin4 to help create a SQL script to create a variety of tables along with creating an EDR to explain the relationship between the tables we created.  I also answered a variety of questions based on the information given from the tables. 

Collaboration with other students- I worked with Hunter Becker when it came to working on this project.  We worked together on completing this project and comparing the results we had gotten. 
I reviewed the in-class meetings and reviewed the examples we went through in these class lessons. 
I used Microsoft copilot to help correct or ask any questions I had when creating my code.
